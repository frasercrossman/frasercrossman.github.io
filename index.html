      <h1>Hi, I'm Fraser</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software engineer who is passionate about developing deep knowledge of complex systems and using that
        to implement novel ideas!

      <p>
        Currently I'm working in London on a fixed income desk developing a high-volume market data feed system and
        suite of Windows-based client applications in Java and C# respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my technical interests I enjoy a broad range of sports and am a member of
        <a href="https://www.curlewrowingclub.co.uk/">Curlew</a> rowing club.
