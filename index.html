        I'm a Computer Science graduate passionate about building cool stuff!
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm working in London as a microservices developer primarily using languages which
        run on the JVM. I have particular interests in startups, functional programming, compilers
        and typography.

        Outside of my technical interests I enjoy a broad range of sports having been a member of a
        football team, running club, korfball team, and rowing crew. In 2019 I ran the
        London Marathon raising money for
        <a href="https://raysofsunshine.org.uk/">Rays of Sunshine</a>, a fantastic charity helping
        children with serious illnesses.
