                I'm a Computer Science graduate with particular interests in Ethereum, functional programming, and
                startups. At the moment, as with many functional programming and startup enthusiasts, I'm
                obsessed with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham's essays</a>.
                I can't recommend them enough to anyone who is currently or has just finished studying Computer Science
                at university.

                Outside of my technical interests I am a keen runner and will soon be taking part in both the Vitality
                Big Half and the Virgin Money London Marathon. If you would like to sponsor me
